# ANPR

Automated number plate recognition (ANPR) systems apply optical character recognition (OCR) in combination with other image processing techniques to read vehicle registration plates. ANPR is one of the most accurate and widely applied computer vision systems, and the applied methods are constantly evolving to increase the performance, accuracy, cost-efficiency, robustness, and scalability of automatic license plate recognition software.
